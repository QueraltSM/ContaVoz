<h1>ContaVoz</h1>
<b>React Native voice app that generates accounting documents<b><br><br>
Contavoz is the ideal complement to accounting programs to streamline and minimize errors when posting documents.
The system is very simple: they will take a photo of the document and/or narrate its basic data: company name or CIF number, date, document number and amount.
Thanks to this methodology, users do not have to be accountants or have accounting knowledge.
Contavoz is integrated into the google voice system and enriches it with its own voice control. In this way, the user's vocal characteristics are adapted.
At the end, the accountant will receive in his control panel the image of the document, and if the document was narrated and thanks to the SIC system (Intelligent Accounting System) he will generate an automatic prior entry to which, if it is correct, he only has to confirm it.
Contavoz has everything necessary for the automatic accounting of documents, whether for the calculation of VAT, IGIC, Withholdings, Investment of the taxpayer, etc.<br><br>
Contavoz also integrates with google drive, allowing you to have a document manager for all accounting documents.
Forget the burden of posting at the last moment, filing them and even locating them in the future.
With Contavoz you won't have to change your accounting program since it has an integration system with the main programs on the market.
Contavoz is the definitive tool to increase and improve the performance of your company.
